## Star Wars Checklist

This repo is home to the Star Wars Checklist which is part of a fun coding challenge.

### Technology Used

This project was built with React using the Create React App boilerplate. I considered using the materialize CSS library but due to the size of the project I opted to create the CSS from scratch. For positioning Flexbox was utilized which helped make the list responsive. A media query was used to make the text responsive. Since the nature of these types of apps/lists are often asynchronous I also added Axios to make a Get request to retrieve the content of the list from a json file.

### Demo

The list was built and hosted on Netlify and can be viewed by clicking this link - [https://lucid-snyder-4c1606.netlify.com/](https://lucid-snyder-4c1606.netlify.com/)
